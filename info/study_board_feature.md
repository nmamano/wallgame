# WIP - STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

# Study board 

The study board is like a level editor for the game.

It can be used to:

- Come up with puzzles with AI assistance
- Explore positions on your own, with AI assistance
- Play vs yourself locally.

# Flow

We start from the Create game page.

Next to the Create game button, we add a Study board button.

Clicking it takes us to the game page, with the configured settings:

- Variant
- Variant-specific settings like board dimensions

Some settings are ignored for study board:

- Timers don't count down in study board. They are hidden.
- Seat A and Seat B configuration is ignored. The user controls all players (similar to "You" vs "Also You").
