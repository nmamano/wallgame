- Use bun, not npm, pnpm, etc.
- Before finishing a task, ensure that `bun run build` and `bun lint` run clean from the frontend directory and `bun test` passes from the root directory.

- If you need new UI components they may be in `frontend/src/components/unused-components/`. Read `frontend/src/components/unused-components/RE_ADDING_COMPONENTS.md` for how to re-add them.
